  title: Party at the Mascot
  story: After a full week of studying hard, you notice in Discord a small group
    of people suggesting to go and drink beer in Mascot, a nearby bar. You know it
    would be fun to relax and chill out and take a break from coding, and you are
    even tempted to really open up and drink like a Finn perhaps. Or maybe you might
    join them, but just really for a drink or two, nothing crazy. Threat or a possibility?
