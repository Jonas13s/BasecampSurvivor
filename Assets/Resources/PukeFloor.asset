  title: Puke on the Floor
  story: You came to School despite the tiredness and the sickness in the stomach.
    You were able to write atleast 20 lines of code and read an article explaining
    the history of C a little bit, until a friend from the party noticed you and
    came to ask how you were, since, you know, you PARTIED LIKE AN ANIMAL. At that
    unfortunate moment, you turn around and retch, releasing a bad, smelly puke on
    the Floor, feeling embarassed. Your friend is in shock and awe, but helps you
    clean the stuff. Bocal will hear of this, you will be possibly punished for causing
    the mess. Confess to the Bocal what happened or try to let it slide?
