  title: Recover from Hangover
  story: Shit, that was hard... You partied until 4 AM and now it's blurry and embarassing
    and sick but it was fun! You think it was! If you recall correctly. What now,
    go to School feeling pukey and risking further embarassment, or just chill at
    home, recovering in peace?
